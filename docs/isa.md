## 1. Design rationale

### 1.1 The ISA serves the compiler
BLIP's instruction set is designed backwards from a single question: *what does
an optimizing C compiler want to emit?* (See goal **G2**.) That means the
machine must natively support the three things C leans on hardest:

1. **Stack-relative locals.** A C function's locals and spilled temporaries live
   in its stack frame. The CPU must address them directly as *(stack pointer +
   displacement)* with no per-access address arithmetic.
2. **Pointer arithmetic and dereference.** Pointers are 16-bit values that get
   added to, indexed, auto-incremented, and dereferenced constantly. The machine
   needs real 16-bit address registers, 16-bit add, and an
   address-of/effective-address operation.
3. **Reentrancy.** A real hardware stack with `CALL`/`RET`/interrupt framing so
   the same code is correct in interrupts, recursion, and across FUZIX tasks.

### 1.2 Why a 6809-flavoured, register-memory machine
The 6809 is the historical high-water mark for 8-bit C, *not* because of folklore
(OS-9/6809 was actually written in **assembly** — the C rewrite came later, on
other CPUs), but because it was deliberately designed for high-level languages,
reentrancy, and position-independent code (Ritter & Boney, *BYTE*, 1979). Its
two stack pointers, index registers with displacement/auto-inc/dec/accumulator
offsets, and a load-effective-address instruction are exactly the primitives a C
code generator wants. BLIP adopts that *shape* (not its encodings).

Contrast with the **Z80**, the other obvious 8-bit C target: the Z80 has no
SP-relative addressing, so compilers must burn an index register (`IX`) as a
frame pointer and pay a slow, prefixed `(IX+d)` for every local — convenient but
costly, and only one good 16-bit adder (`HL`). BLIP avoids both warts.

### 1.3 Toolchain: a new SDCC backend (STM8-derived)
Because BLIP is a clean-sheet ISA, **no existing toolchain works out of the box
for any choice** — a backend must be written regardless. The plan is a new
**SDCC** port:

- SDCC is a retargetable optimizing C compiler purpose-built for constrained
  8-bit machines; its register allocator and peephole optimizer are
  target-agnostic.
- The **STM8** backend is the closest architectural relative (stack-relative,
  16-bit index registers, index+displacement) and the recommended base to clone.
  SDCC's maintainer has stated on record that 6809-class stack-relative machines
  map well onto SDCC, citing STM8 as the proof.
- **GCC** (à la `gcc6809`) would give stronger codegen but is a multi-month
  first-time effort; **LLVM** is the worst fit for register-scarce 8-bit. Both
  are documented alternatives, not the plan.

A consequence for the ISA: every addressing mode and the calling convention
should map cleanly onto things an SDCC/STM8-style code generator already knows
how to choose. We co-design the ISA *and* the backend.

### 1.4 FUZIX shapes the system instructions
Running FUZIX (goal **G3**) means the ISA must include the machinery an OS needs:
maskable interrupts with a clean save/restore frame, a software interrupt /
trap for system calls, atomic-enough primitives for the scheduler, and a way to
reprogram the MMU page table on a context switch (see §6).

## 2. Programming model (register file v0)

All registers are programmer-visible unless noted. 8-bit unless a width is given.

**User-mode programmer registers:**

| Reg | Width | Role |
|-----|-------|------|
| `A` | 8 | Primary accumulator |
| `B` | 8 | Secondary accumulator |
| `D` | 16 | The pair `A:B` (A = high) used as a 16-bit accumulator |
| `X` | 16 | Index/pointer register |
| `Y` | 16 | Index/pointer register |
| `SP`| 16 | **Stack pointer** — C call frames; *banked by privilege* (see below) |
| `PC`| 16 | Program counter (logical address) |
| `CC`| 8 | Condition codes / processor state |

**Privilege mode & the banked stack pointer.** BLIP has two CPU modes,
**supervisor** and **user** (a real hardware kernel/user split — see
[§6](#6-system--privileged-behaviour-for-fuzix)). The name `SP` always refers to
the *active* stack pointer, but there are physically two:

| Reg | Width | Role |
|-----|-------|------|
| `USP` | 16 | User stack pointer — active in user mode |
| `SSP` | 16 | Supervisor stack pointer — active in supervisor mode |

A trap/interrupt switches to supervisor mode (so the kernel runs on `SSP`, which
user code cannot name or corrupt); `RTI` restores the saved mode. The kernel can
read/write `USP` explicitly to set up a user stack (68000-style). MMU control and
other privileged operations are legal only in supervisor mode.

**`CC` layout (decided):** 8 bits `E F H I N Z V C` (bit7→bit0): `E` entire-frame
(so `RTI` knows how much to restore), `F` fast-IRQ mask, `H` half-carry, `I` IRQ
mask, and the ALU flags `N`/`Z`/`V`/`C`. The supervisor/user **mode is separate
processor state, not a `CC` bit** (it is saved/restored with the interrupt frame).
See §8.4.

**Why this set.** Two 8-bit accumulators that pair into 16-bit `D` give cheap
`char` math *and* 16-bit `int`/pointer math. `X` and `Y` plus stack-relative
addressing (`n,SP`) cover C's pointer and locals needs — this is exactly the
**STM8** register shape (`X`, `Y`, `SP`), which SDCC already targets well, so the
backend has a proven template. The banked `SSP`/`USP` give the FUZIX kernel a
stack a misbehaving process literally cannot reach, turning the MMU's per-process
isolation into genuine kernel protection.

**Why no `U` and no `DP`.** We drop the 6809's second user stack `U` (a third
live pointer is a luxury; `X`/`Y`/`n,SP` suffice, per STM8) — the second stack
pointer instead earns its keep as the *supervisor* stack. We drop the direct-page
register `DP` because it solves a different problem than the MMU and pays off
little for C: direct/zero-page addressing buys code density for *hot globals*, but
C keeps its hot data (locals) on the stack, not in a fixed global page. (If we
later want the density win for I/O or kernel globals, a *fixed* zero page —
automatically per-process via the MMU — is the cheaper way to get it; see
[§4](#4-addressing-modes).)

### 2.1 Internal (non-programmer-visible) registers
Used by microcode only; documented here for completeness and because they drive
the blinkenlights: `MAR` (memory address register, 16-bit logical), `IR`
(instruction register), `µPC` (microprogram counter), and ALU operand/temp
latches `TA`/`TB`. See [docs/hardware.md](hardware.md).

---

## 3. Data types and the C model

| C type | Size | Held in / notes |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| `char` | 8 | `A`/`B`, or memory |
| `int`, `short` | 16 | `D`/`X`/`Y`; **little-endian** in memory |
| `long` | 32 | register pair + memory, or memory |
| pointer | 16 | **near**: a flat logical address within the process's 64 KB view |
| `enum` | 16 | as `int` |

`float`/`double` and `long long` are library/soft-float; FUZIX itself leans on
`char`/`int`/`long` and 16-bit pointers, which is BLIP's sweet spot.

> **Decided — byte order: little-endian.** It matches every existing SDCC port,
> minimizing backend friction; we accept this over 6809-style big-endian.

---

## 4. Addressing modes

These are the C-critical modes; they mirror the 6809's model because it is the
one proven to make a code generator happy.

| Mode | Syntax | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| Inherent | `NOP`, `RTS` | no operand |
| Immediate | `#imm8` / `#imm16` | constants |
| Extended | `addr16` | absolute 16-bit address |
| Indexed: constant offset | `n,X` `n,Y` `n,SP` | **stack-relative locals**, struct fields |
| Indexed: zero offset | `,X` | pointer dereference |
| Indexed: accumulator offset | `A,X` `B,X` `D,X` | `array[i]` in one instruction |
| Indexed: auto inc/dec | `,X+` `,X++` `,-X` `,--X` | `*p++`, stack-walks |
| Indexed: indirect | `[n,X]` `[,X++]` | pointer-to-pointer, jump tables |
| PC-relative | `n,PCR` `[n,PCR]` | position-independent code/data |
| Relative (branch) | `label` | conditional/unconditional branches (8- and 16-bit) |

The two that earn their keep for C:

- **`n,SP`** — a local at frame offset *n* is one instruction, no frame-pointer
  setup tax. This is the single biggest win over the Z80.
- **`LEA`** (load effective address, §7) — computes `r = address(mode)` so
  `p += n`, `&local`, and `&array[i]` are single instructions; it's how pointer
  arithmetic stays cheap.

Constant offsets come in **5-bit**, **8-bit**, and **16-bit** widths (chosen by
the postbyte, §5.2) so small frames and struct accesses stay compact while large
frames still work.

---

## 5. Instruction encoding

### 5.1 Opcode space — a single page
There is exactly **one 256-entry opcode page** — no prefix bytes. Every instruction
is one opcode byte followed by 0–3 trailing bytes: an optional indexed postbyte,
then 0–2 offset / immediate / address bytes. Decode is microcoded, so the opcode
byte need not be bit-field-structured; the full table is §8.

```
[ opcode ] [ postbyte? ] [ operand bytes 0..2 ]
```

### 5.2 The indexed **postbyte**
Indexed-mode instructions carry one postbyte that selects the index register and
the sub-mode (zero/constant/accumulator offset, auto inc/dec, indirect, PC-rel).
The full bit layout is specified in §8.3; the *set* of modes it must encode is
fixed by §4.

### 5.3 Branch offsets
Short (conditional) branches use an 8-bit signed offset (`Bcc`, `0x20–0x2F`); long
branches use a 16-bit signed offset (`LBcc`, `0xB0–0xBF`) so the compiler is never
boxed in by ±128 bytes.

> **Resolved:** single opcode page (no prefix pages); the postbyte bit layout is in
> §8.3 and operands are little-endian (§3).

---

## 6. System / privileged behaviour (for FUZIX)

BLIP has two CPU modes, **supervisor** and **user**, selected by a mode bit held
as separate processor state (not in `CC`; see [§2](#2-programming-model-register-file-v0)
and §8.4). User code runs in user mode on `USP`; the kernel runs in supervisor
mode on `SSP`. This gives a real hardware kernel/user boundary on top of the
per-process address map.

Process isolation rests on two cheap mechanisms: each process's map only covers
its own pages (R-MEM-3), and the instructions that could change a map or otherwise
escape the sandbox are privileged (below) — together satisfying R-CPU-4. Per-page
access protection (read-only / no-access faulting) is a **non-goal** (decision log
D-18).

- **Mode entry/exit.** Every trap or interrupt switches to **supervisor** mode,
  switches the active stack to `SSP`, and selects the kernel MMU map set —
  atomically, in microcode. `RTI` restores the saved mode (hence the user stack
  bank and user map set). A user program cannot raise its own privilege except by
  trapping into the kernel.
- **Privileged operations** (supervisor-only; attempted in user mode → a
  **privilege-violation trap**): MMU control (`LDMMU`/`STMMU`), `RTI`, the
  interrupt-mask instructions (`SEI`/`CLI`/`SEF`/`CLF`), `HALT`/`SYNC`, and the
  `SSP`/`USP` banking moves. `SWI` and everything a process needs for ordinary
  computation stay unprivileged. To keep "interrupt-mask changes" actually
  privileged, user-mode `CC` writes (`ANDCC`/`ORCC`/`CWAI`/`PULS CC`) cannot alter
  the `I`, `F`, or `E` bits (see §8.7).
- **Interrupts.** Maskable `IRQ` (mask `CC.I`) and a faster `FIRQ` (mask `CC.F`)
  that stacks a minimal frame; a non-maskable `NMI`. The frame is pushed on
  `SSP`; `RTI` restores per `CC.E`.
- **System call / trap.** A software interrupt (`SWI`, possibly `SWI2`/`SWI3`) is
  FUZIX's kernel-entry trap: it enters supervisor mode with a saved frame.
- **MMU control.** Address translation is internal to the CPU (see
  [docs/hardware.md](hardware.md) §3); its page table is an internal privileged
  register file, written only in supervisor mode by dedicated instructions
  (`LDMMU`/`STMMU`). It is reprogrammed on a context switch. A region of memory
  stays mapped at a fixed location in every map set, for the always-resident
  kernel code and the inter-map copy routines (R-MEM-4); the active map set follows
  the privilege mode (R-MEM-5).
- **Reset.** On reset the CPU enters supervisor mode with interrupts masked and
  begins at a fixed reset vector (R-CPU-7); the page table comes up as an identity
  map of the low 64 KB (logical = physical), so the machine runs before any
  translation is configured (R-MEM-7).
- **Atomicity.** At minimum, disabling interrupts around critical sections; a
  test-and-set-like primitive is a possible convenience (TBD).

---

## 7. Calling convention (ABI)

> The single, stable convention that the C toolchain and hand-written assembly
> both follow (R-ABI-1) — fixed, not an implementation detail free to drift.

**Reentrancy & locals.** Parameters, locals, and return linkage live on a
per-call stack; locals are reached by `n,SP` displacement, with no frame-pointer
register (R-ISA-1, R-ISA-2, R-ISA-8).

**Argument passing.** Leading scalar arguments go in registers; the rest are
pushed on the stack **right-to-left** (R-ABI-2; right-to-left so a variadic callee
finds its fixed arguments at known low offsets):
- first 8-bit argument → `B`;
- first 16-bit argument → `X`;
- a second scalar fills the still-free class (`A` for a byte, or `B` if the first
  was 16-bit). There is **no** second 16-bit register slot — `Y` is reserved (see
  save discipline) — so a second 16-bit argument goes on the stack;
- `struct`/`union` arguments, and **all** arguments of a variadic function, go on
  the stack.

**Return values.**
- 8-bit → `B`; 16-bit → `X` (an address-capable register, so a returned pointer is
  usable immediately — R-ABI-3);
- 32-bit, `struct`, and `union` → **hidden pointer**: the caller allocates the
  result space and passes its address as an implicit first argument in `X`; the
  callee writes the result there.

**Register save discipline.**
- **Callee-saved (preserved across a call): `Y`.** A function that uses `Y` saves
  and restores it. This gives the compiler one 16-bit register to hold a value —
  typically a loop-carried pointer — live across a call without spilling (R-ABI-4).
- **Caller-saved (clobberable): `A`, `B`/`D`, `X`, `CC`.** The caller preserves any
  it needs across a call.

**Stack cleanup.** The **caller** removes arguments after the call (keeps variadic
calls simple and the convention uniform).

**Why the boundary registers.** `D = A:B`, so an 8-bit value in `B` (the low half)
widens to 16-bit by just setting `A` — cheap C integer promotion (R-ISA-7). 16-bit
values are usually pointers, so passing/returning them in `X` lets them be
dereferenced or indexed with no move (R-ABI-3, R-ISA-5). Reserving `Y` rather than
spending it as a second argument register is what lets the convention satisfy
R-ABI-2 *and* R-ABI-4 together; BLIP can afford it because the 16-bit `SP`
displacement removes any need for `Y` as a frame pointer (R-ISA-2).

### 8.1 Encoding model

Every instruction is **one opcode byte** plus 0–3 trailing bytes: an optional
indexed postbyte (§8.3), then 0–2 offset/immediate/address bytes. No prefix bytes;
maximum length is 4 (opcode + postbyte + 2). Decode is microcoded, so the opcode
need not be bit-structured — but the regular grids below are kept because they let
shared microcode serve a whole band.

| Band | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `0x00–0x1F` | Inherent / system / inter-register (incl. relocated `SEI/CLI/SEF/CLF`, USP banking, `LDMMU/STMMU`, `TAS`) |
| `0x20–0x2F` | Short branches `Bcc rel8` — **low nibble = condition** |
| `0x30–0x3F` | Effective address, `JMP`, and the wide compares `CMPD/CMPY/CMPSP` |
| `0x40–0x7F` | Read-modify-write unary ops — a **4×16 grid**: high nibble = operand (`4`=A, `5`=B, `6`=indexed, `7`=extended), low nibble = operation |
| `0x80–0xAF` | A/D ALU & load group — **3×16**: high nibble = mode (`8`=immediate, `9`=indexed, `A`=extended), low nibble = operation |
| `0xB0–0xBF` | Long branches `LBcc rel16` — **low nibble = condition** (mirrors `0x20–0x2F`) |
| `0xC0–0xEF` | B / wide-register group — **3×16**: (`C`=immediate, `D`=indexed, `E`=extended) |
| `0xF0–0xFF` | `SP` load/store (`0xF0–0xF4`); rest reserved |

Stores (low nibble `7`/`D`/`F`) and `JSR` (low nibble `D`) exist only in the
memory-operand rows; the immediate rows leave those slots reserved (store-immediate
and JSR-immediate are meaningless) — intentional, not a gap.

### 8.2 Primary opcode matrix (the whole 256-byte page)

Rows = high nibble, columns = low nibble; `—` = reserved. Cells show the mnemonic;

Mode/length per cell where it isn't obvious from the band:

- **`3x`:** `0x33/0x38/0x39` = `CMPD` imm/indexed/extended; `0x34/0x3A/0x3B` = `CMPY`
  imm/indexed/extended; `0x35/0x3C/0x3D` = `CMPSP` imm/indexed/extended; `0x36`=`JMP`
  indexed, `0x37`=`JMP` extended.
- **`1x` relocated system ops:** `0x19 TAS` indexed (atomic test-and-set);
  `0x1A TFRU`/`0x1B EXGU` = the privileged `TFR`/`EXG` *USP-banking* forms (postbyte
  with register code `USP`); `0x1C LDMMU`/`0x1D STMMU` take an `#imm8` page-table
  entry index (data via `D`).
- **`Fx`:** `0xF0` `LDSP` indexed, `0xF1` `LDSP` extended, `0xF2` `STSP` indexed,
  `0xF3` `STSP` extended, `0xF4` `LDSP #imm16`.
- **Lengths:** inherent = 1; `#imm8` / mask / `#imm8`-selector = 2; `#imm16` /
  extended / `rel16` = 3; `rel8` = 2; postbyte ops (`TFR`/`EXG`/`PSHS`/`PULS`) = 2;
  **indexed = 2–4** (opcode + postbyte + 0/1/2 offset bytes).

### 8.3 Indexed postbyte

One postbyte follows the opcode for any indexed instruction; bit 7 picks the form.
Register field `RR`: `00`=X, `01`=Y, `10`=SP, `11`=PC.

**Form A — 5-bit constant offset (bit7 = 0):** `0 | RR(6:5) | nnnnn(4:0)` — signed
5-bit offset −16…+15, no extra bytes, no indirect. The assembler's densest case.

**Form B — general (bit7 = 1):** `1 | RR(6:5) | I(4) | TTTT(3:0)`, where `I` =
indirect (one extra level of dereference):

| `TTTT` | Mode | Extra bytes |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `0000` | `,R+` auto-inc by 1 (post) | 0 — `I` must be 0 |
| `0001` | `,R++` auto-inc by 2 (post) | 0 |
| `0010` | `,-R` auto-dec by 1 (pre) | 0 — `I` must be 0 |
| `0011` | `,--R` auto-dec by 2 (pre) | 0 |
| `0100` | `,R` zero offset | 0 |
| `0101` | `B,R` accumulator-B offset | 0 |
| `0110` | `A,R` accumulator-A offset | 0 |
| `1000` | `n,R` 8-bit signed offset | 1 |
| `1001` | `n,R` 16-bit signed offset | 2 (LE) |
| `1011` | `D,R` accumulator-D offset | 0 |
| `1100` | `n,PCR` 8-bit PC-relative | 1 (RR→PC) |
| `1101` | `n,PCR` 16-bit PC-relative | 2 (RR→PC) |
| `1111` | `[addr16]` extended-indirect | 2 (requires `I`=1) |
| `0111`,`1010`,`1110` | reserved | — |

There is one canonical encoding per (mode, register, width, indirect) tuple, so the
assembler/disassembler round-trips. The privileged USP-banking moves (`0x1A`/`0x1B`)
do **not** use this postbyte — they use the `TFR`/`EXG` register-code postbyte (§8.4)
with the `USP` code.

### 8.4 Register & flag encoding

**`CC` (8 bits, MSB→LSB):** `E F H I N Z V C` — bit7 `E` entire-frame, bit6 `F`
fast-IRQ mask, bit5 `H` half-carry, bit4 `I` IRQ mask, bit3 `N`, bit2 `Z`, bit1
`V`, bit0 `C`. There is **no mode bit in `CC`** — the supervisor/user mode is
separate processor state (saved/restored with the interrupt frame).

**`TFR`/`EXG` postbyte:** `src(7:4) | dst(3:0)`, each a 4-bit register code; source
and destination must be the same width.
- 16-bit: `D`=0, `X`=1, `Y`=2, `SP`=3, `PC`=4. (e.g. `TFR D,X` = `0x01`.)
- 8-bit: `A`=8, `B`=9, `CC`=`0xA`. (e.g. `EXG A,B` = `0x89`.)
- `USP`=`0xF` — referencing it is the **privileged** USP-banking form (`0x1A`/`0x1B`),
  which traps in user mode. Codes `5`,`6`,`7`,`B`–`E` reserved.

**`PSHS`/`PULS` mask byte** (one bit per register; push high-address-first, pull
reverse, so the same mask round-trips): bit0 `CC`, bit1 `A`, bit2 `B`, bit3
*reserved*, bit4 `X`, bit5 `Y`, bit6 `SP` (the other/banked `SP` image), bit7 `PC`.
`D` is pushed/pulled as `A`+`B` (bits 1+2). The implicit stack is the active one
(`USP` in user mode, `SSP` in supervisor), so user code can't reach the kernel stack.

### 8.5 Flag effects by operation class

Notation: `*` set from result, `0`/`1` forced, `-` unaffected, `?` undefined.

| Class | N | Z | V | C | H |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LDr` / `STr` | * | * | 0 | - | - |

### 8.6 Relocations & reserved slots

Going single-page meant packing the ops that had been on prefix pages into holes:

- **Long branches** `LBcc` fill row `0xB0–0xBF` (low nibble = condition, mirroring
  `0x20–0x2F`), so one condition-decoder serves both.
- **Wide compares** `CMPD/CMPY/CMPSP` (9 forms) take the `0x30`-row holes (`0x33–0x3D`).
- **Interrupt-mask** `SEI/CLI/SEF/CLF` → `0x0C–0x0F`; **USP banking** `TFRU/EXGU` →
  `0x1A/0x1B`; **MMU** `LDMMU/STMMU` → `0x1C/0x1D`; **`TAS`** → `0x19`; **`HALT`** →
  `0x18`.

**Reserved (free for growth):** `0x1E/0x1F`; `0x3E/0x3F`; the RMW holes
(low nibbles `1/2/5/B/E` in each of `0x4x–0x7x`); the immediate-row holes
`0x87/0x8D/0x8F` (A/D) and `0xC7/0xCD/0xCF` (B/wide); and `0xF5–0xFF`. ~40 slots in
all — the hard 256 ceiling is accepted (D-21).

### 8.7 Privilege & the user-mode `CC` mask

Privileged instructions (trap in user mode): `SYNC` (`0x01`), `RTI` (`0x11`),
`SEI`/`CLI`/`SEF`/`CLF` (`0x0C–0x0F`), `HALT` (`0x18`), `TFRU`/`EXGU` (`0x1A`/`0x1B`),
`LDMMU`/`STMMU` (`0x1C`/`0x1D`). `SWI`/`SWI2`/`SWI3` are **unprivileged** — the
syscall gateway. Plain `TFR`/`EXG` (`0x06`/`0x07`) stay unprivileged; only the
USP-banking variants are privileged.

Because `ANDCC`/`ORCC`/`CWAI` and `PULS CC` write `CC` directly, they would
otherwise let user code clear the `I`/`F` interrupt masks. So **in user mode those
instructions cannot alter the `I`, `F`, or `E` bits** — attempts are ignored (only
`N Z V C H` are writable), and `PULS CC` restores only `N Z V C H`. The `I`/`F`
masks change only via the privileged `SEI`/`CLI`/`SEF`/`CLF` and via `RTI`/trap
entry. This is what makes "interrupt-mask changes are privileged" (R-CPU-4,
R-CPU-6) actually hold.

1. **Reset details (§6):** the reset-vector location and the exact reset values of
   `PC`/`SP`.

*Decided:* registers `A B D X Y SP` (no `U`/`DP`); little-endian; privilege with
banked `SSP`/`USP` and the mode bit as separate state (not in `CC`); internal MMU
(physical external bus, 16 MB / 8 KB pages, identity-mapped at reset, programmed by
privileged `LDMMU`/`STMMU`); calling convention (§7); and the full **single-page**
encoding, indexed postbyte, and 256-entry opcode table (§8).
